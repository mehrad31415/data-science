# data-science

##### This was the first project of the data science course. 

## Research question: 

What are the leading causes of death in the US?

## Background:

It is found that “the news media significantly misrepresent the
prevalence of leading causes of death and their risk factors” (e.g. Frost et
al. 842).

### Data:

There are three data sets on specific causes of death (by year) in the US taken from three
different sources: Google Trends, US Centre for Disease Control, and
The New York Times. 

### Objective:
1) Wrangling the three existing data sets into a single data set.
2) Creating an informative visualization based on the data sets.
